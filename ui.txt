# Current UI Implementation Status

This document describes the current visual and functional state of the **Reputation Passport** application, based on the codebase analysis.

## 1. Global Design System
The application features a polished, "Trust-First" aesthetic designed to look futuristic yet professional.

*   **Theme**: Dark Mode default.
    *   **Background**: Deep charcoal/navy (`#0F1724`).
    *   **Panels**: "Glassmorphism" style — translucent backgrounds with background blur (`backdrop-filter: blur()`), subtle white borders (`border-white/10`), and soft shadows.
*   **Typography**:
    *   **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* — Geometric, tech-focused sans-serif.
    *   **Body**: *Inter* — Clean, standard UI font for readability.
    *   **Data/Numbers**: *JetBrains Mono* — Monospace font used for scores, hashes, and stats to imply "engineering precision".
*   **Color Palette**:
    *   **Primary**: "Trust Blue" (Azure/Royal Blue gradients).
    *   **Accent**: "Growth Green" (Emerald/Mint for success states and value).
    *   **Gradients**: Used heavily in text (`.gradient-text`), buttons, and backgrounds.

## 2. Key Pages & Sections

### A. Landing Page (`/`)
User's first point of entry. Designed to convert.

*   **Navigation Bar**: Sticky "glass" header. Logo on left ("RP" shield), "Get Started" button on right.
*   **Hero Section**:
    *   **Left**: Large Value Proposition ("Your On-Chain Reputation Passport"). Three floating "pill" badges listing key benefits (Verifiable, Portable, Visual).
    *   **Right**: **3D-like NFT Preview**. A large card that rotates with mouse movement (parallax effect). It features floating particles, a "Gold" tier badge, and a glowing reputation score.
*   **Mini Demo Strip**: Three icons showing the workflow: "Verify GitHub" -> "Issue Certs" -> "Recruiter Verify".
*   **Pricing Section**: Three cards (Student, Professional, Enterprise). The "Professional" card glows and has a "Most Popular" tag.
*   **Footer**: Simple minimalist footer with copyright.

### B. Onboarding Flow (`/onboarding`)
A structured 5-step wizard to set up the profile.

*   **Layout**: Two-column layout.
    *   **Left sidebar**: Vertical progress stepper (Identity -> Connect -> Verify -> Visibility -> Preview). Completed steps light up.
    *   **Right panel**: The active form area in a glass container.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Identity**: Input fields for Display Name, Handle, Email. Drag & Drop zone for Avatar.
    2.  **Connect Sources**: Interactive toggles for GitHub, Google, Wallet. Expanding the GitHub toggle reveals a simulated "Contribution Graph" preview.
    3.  **Verify Certificates**: Large drag & drop area to upload PDF/PNG certificates. Shows a trust icon ("Cryptographically hashed").
    4.  **Visibility**: Toggles to set specific data points (Repos, Certs) to Public or Private.
    5.  **Preview**: Final review. Shows the generated NFT Card. Clicking "Create Passport" triggers a "Hashing" animation sequence (Processing -> Confirming -> Success).

### C. Profile Page (`/profile`)
The main dashboard for a user.

*   **Hero NFT Card**: The centerpiece. A high-fidelity detailed card component.
    *   **Visuals**: Background gradient changes based on "Tier" (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond).
    *   **Animations**: Continuous "breathing" scale animation. Floating particle effects inside the card.
    *   **Interactions**: Buttons to Share, Mint (SBT), and Export. Clicking the card expands it into a detailed modal showing trait metadata (Glow Intensity, Badge Count).
*   **Reputation Strip**: A horizontal row of "Pill" stats below the card. Shows numeric breakdown of Reputation Score, Verified Certs, and Endorsements.
*   **Reputation Graph**:
    *   **Visuals**: An interactive D3/SVG visualization.
    *   **Nodes**: Differently colored circles representing Skills (Blue), Certs (Green), Projects (Purple), and Hackathons (Orange).
    *   **Dynamics**: Nodes float in a force-directed layout. Hovering highlights connections.
*   **Activity Timeline**: A vertical list of verified events. Each item shows a date, an icon, and a "Verified" tick mark.

## 3. Micro-Interactions
*   **Hover Effects**: Buttons scale up slightly (`scale-105`) and glow.
*   **Page Transitions**: Smooth fade-in and slide-up effects (`framer-motion`) when navigating between pages.
*   **Loaders**: Custom spinners and skeleton screens for data loading states.
